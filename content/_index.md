# d3c3nt

d3c3nt is a simple, clean, and flexible theme for personal sites, made by
[FIGBERT] for the [Zola static site generator][zola]. This theme is
actively developed mainly for use on my personal site, so new features
and styles will be added when I stumble onto the need to make them. All
in all, it's fairly decent.

For more information, [check out the documentation][docs].
