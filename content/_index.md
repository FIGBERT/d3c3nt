# d3c3nt

d3c3nt is a simple, clean, and flexible theme for personal sites, made by
[FIGBERT] for the [Zola static site engine][zola]. This theme is
developed mainly for use on my personal site, so new features and styles
will be added when I stumble onto the need to make them.

All in all, it's fairly... decent.

For more information, [check out the documentation][docs].
